Performed regression analysis on NYC EMS service data (2008-2016) for efficient ambulance response time prediction.
Employed metrics such as Mean Standard Error, R2, Adjusted R2, and p-value to assess the impact of individual variables
and identify the optimal subset of variables contributing to more reliable ambulance response time predictions.
